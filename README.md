# Transactions in Microservices

This repository contains multiple implementations of the Saga pattern for managing distributed transactions in microservices.

## Implementations

- **Saga Orchestration with Kafka and Spring WebFlux**: 
  - This implementation is built from scratch using Kafka and Spring WebFlux. 
  - [View the implementation here](https://github.com/Ismail-Ahrd/Transactions-in-Microservices/tree/main/Saga-orchestration-kafka)

- **Saga Orchestration using the Axon Framework**: 
  - This implementation leverages the Axon Framework to manage Saga orchestration.
  - [View the implementation here](https://github.com/Ismail-Ahrd/Transactions-in-Microservices/tree/main/Saga-orchestration-axon)

- **Proposed Solution for the Propagation Problem in Multi-Level Transactions**: 
  - This section includes a proposition of a solution to address the propagation problem in multi-level transactions.

For a deeper understanding and detailed explanations, you can refer to this series of blog posts on my Medium page: [Microservices Series](https://medium.com/p/1758b61e1cfa). In these posts, I cover complex topics related to microservices, including security and distributed transactions.
